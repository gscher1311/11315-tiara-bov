## B. PRO FORMA RENT (Conservative -- Underwriting Grade)

From Rent Comp Survey (Feb 2026), using conservative scenario:

| Unit | Type | SF | Pro Forma Rent | Rent/SF | Basis |
|------|------|----|---------------|---------|-------|
| 1 | 3bd/2ba | 1,350 | $4,100 | $3.04 | Bracketed by Comps #8 ($3,895), #9 ($3,950), #1 ($4,100). Subject's premium reno supports top of small-building range. |
| 2 | 3bd/2ba | 1,300 | $4,000 | $3.08 | Comps #5 ($3,395) and #8 ($3,895) bracket; subject's condition and utilities-included justify premium. |
| 3 | 3bd/2ba | 1,150 | $3,900 | $3.39 | 2nd floor premium but smallest 3bd. Comps #7 ($3,390-$3,852) and #8 ($3,895). |
| 4 (JADU) | 1bd/1ba | 550 | $2,300 | $4.18 | Unfurnished basis. Comps J1-J4 ($2,095-$2,455). Subject smaller but renovated. |
| **TOTAL** | | **4,350** | **$14,300** | **$3.29** | **$171,600/yr** |

## C. OPERATING STATEMENT (Buyer-Normalized, Broker-Optimistic)

### Income

| Line Item | Current (Buyer-Normalized) | Pro Forma (Conservative) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Gross Scheduled Rent (GSR) | $184,800 | $171,600 | [1] |

| **Total Income** | **$179,256** | **$166,452** | |

### Expenses

| Line Item | Annual | Per Unit (4) | % EGI (PF) | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|-------|
| Property Taxes | $12,714 | $3,179 | 7.6% | [4] Current Prop 13 basis; see reassessment note |
| Insurance | $4,000 | $1,000 | 2.4% | [5] |
| Water/Sewer | $4,800 | $1,200 | 2.9% | [6] |
| Trash | $1,600 | $400 | 1.0% | [7] |
| Gas (landlord-paid, master metered) | $2,400 | $600 | 1.4% | [8] |
| Electric (landlord-paid, partially metered) | $3,600 | $900 | 2.2% | [9] |
| Common Area Electric | $1,500 | $375 | 0.9% | [10] |
| Repairs & Maintenance | $4,400 | $1,100 | 2.6% | [11] |
| Contract Services | $1,500 | $375 | 0.9% | [12] |
| Administrative | $1,000 | $250 | 0.6% | [13] |

### Net Operating Income

| Metric | Current (Buyer-Normalized) | Pro Forma (Conservative) |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Total Income | $179,256 | $166,452 |
| Total Expenses | $45,926 | $45,926 |
| **Net Operating Income (NOI)** | **$133,330** | **$120,526** |

**Expense Ratio:** 27.6% of Pro Forma EGI
- This is below the typical 40-55% range for small buildings because the property has very few common areas, no pool, no elevator, no hallways to maintain, and the recent full renovation minimizes repairs. The utilities-included structure inflates both income and expenses but the net effect is captured.

## D. NOTES TO OPERATING STATEMENT

[1] **GSR:** Current (Buyer-Normalized) = all units at current/market rents, including **vacant Unit 2 at its $4,200/mo market asking rent**. This represents what the property generates at stabilized full occupancy ($15,400/mo = $184,800/yr). Actual current collection with Unit 2 vacant is $11,200/mo ($134,400/yr). Pro Forma Conservative uses Rent Comp Survey figures ($14,300/mo = $171,600/yr).

[2] **Vacancy:** 3% of GSR. Broker-optimistic for a renovated, well-located triplex in a strong rental market. NoHo vacancy rates for renovated product are low. Note: Unit 2 is currently vacant -- at stabilization, 3% is appropriate.

[3] **Other Income:** No laundry income (in-unit hookups), no parking premium (included in rent), no RUBS. If a buyer implements RUBS or separate utility metering, this would add $5,000-$8,000/yr in recoveries.

[4] **Property Taxes:** Current assessed at $1,020,000 (Prop 13 basis). Taxes shown at current level ($12,714). **CRITICAL: Taxes will be reassessed at purchase price.** At an assumed $2.1M purchase: $2,100,000 x 1.17% = $24,570/yr (+$11,856/yr increase). See sensitivity table below.

[5] **Insurance:** $4,000/yr per seller estimate. $1,000/unit is within Tier 1 benchmark range ($800-$1,200). Pre-1940 construction would add +$100-150/unit but the full renovation of all systems offsets this. Using seller actual.

[6] **Water/Sewer:** $4,800/yr per appraisal (landlord-paid, always). At $480/bedroom (10 bedrooms), this is within the $400-$650/bedroom benchmark range.

[7] **Trash:** $400/unit benchmark for Tier 1. Landlord always pays. LA requires recycling/organic bins.

[8] **Gas:** Landlord-paid (all utilities included in rent). 3 gas meters but owner pays. Using $600/unit master-metered benchmark for Tier 1.

[9] **Electric:** Landlord-paid. 3 electric meters (Units 3+4 share). Using $650/bedroom benchmark adjusted down because individual meters exist (even though owner pays). 10 bedrooms x $360 = $3,600. Higher than individually-metered rate but lower than full master-metered because partial metering exists.

[10] **Common Area Electric:** $1,500/yr flat for Tier 1. Minimal common area (driveway, exterior lights).

[11] **Repairs & Maintenance:** Broker-optimistic: $1,200/unit base (Tier 1) minus $100/unit for recent major renovation = $1,100/unit x 4 = $4,400. All systems brand new (2024-2025), so reduced maintenance expected for 3-5 years.

[12] **Contract Services:** $1,500/yr broker-optimistic for Tier 1. Minimal landscaping (small lot, no extensive grounds), no interior hallways, no security.

[13] **Administrative:** $1,000/yr broker-optimistic for Tier 1. Accounting, legal, bank fees, permits.

[14] **Marketing:** $500/yr. Strong rental market in NoHo; renovated product leases quickly. Minimal advertising needed.

[15] **Management Fee:** 4% of EGI (broker-optimistic for Tier 1). Many 3-4 unit buyers self-manage, but fee included for normalization. At $6,658/yr, this is well below the $18,000 minimum that professional management companies typically charge for small accounts. **In practice, a buyer of a 3-4 unit property will self-manage.** The fee is included to normalize for comparison purposes only.

[16] **Reserves:** $200/unit (broker-optimistic for 2010+ equivalent due to full renovation). All systems new: electrical (2025), plumbing (2024), HVAC (2024), roof. Reserve needs are minimal for the next 5-10 years.

[17] **Other/Misc:** $250/yr broker-optimistic for Tier 1. Minimal miscellaneous costs.

[18] **SCEP Fees:** $67.94/unit x 3 legal units = $203.82/yr. JADU not separately registered. 50% passable to tenants.

## E. PROPERTY TAX REASSESSMENT SENSITIVITY

| Purchase Price | Annual Taxes (1.17%) | Increase vs. Current | Impact on NOI |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| $1,750,000 | $20,475 | +$7,761 | NOI drops ~$7.8K |

## G. KEY METRICS AT VARIOUS PRICE POINTS

*GRM = Price / Annual GSR. $/SF uses appraiser-measured 4,243 SF for comp consistency. DSCR uses reassessed taxes at purchase price.*

### Using Pro Forma Conservative ($14,300/mo = $171,600/yr GSR)

| Price | Cap (Current Tax) | Cap (Reassessed) | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM | DSCR (Reassessed) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|------|-----|-------------------|
| $1,750,000 | 6.89% | 6.44% | $437,500 | $412 | 10.2 | 1.10 |
| $1,950,000 | 6.18% | 5.66% | $487,500 | $460 | 11.4 | 0.97 |
| $2,100,000 | 5.74% | 5.17% | $525,000 | $495 | 12.2 | 0.89 |
| $2,350,000 | 5.13% | 4.50% | $587,500 | $554 | 13.7 | 0.77 |

### Using Current Buyer-Normalized ($15,400/mo = $184,800/yr GSR)

| Price | Cap (Current Tax) | Cap (Reassessed) | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM | DSCR (Reassessed) |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|------|-----|-------------------|
| $1,750,000 | 7.62% | 7.18% | $437,500 | $412 | 9.5 | 1.23 |
| $1,950,000 | 6.84% | 6.32% | $487,500 | $460 | 10.6 | 1.08 |
| $2,100,000 | 6.35% | 5.78% | $525,000 | $495 | 11.4 | 0.99 |
| $2,350,000 | 5.67% | 5.04% | $587,500 | $554 | 12.7 | 0.86 |

*Note: Cash-on-Cash returns omitted -- varies significantly by buyer profile (owner-user vs. investor, LTV, rate). At 75% LTV / 6.75% with reassessed taxes, leveraged cash flow turns negative above ~$1.85M on PF rents and ~$2.1M on current rents. However, residential 3-4 unit buyers frequently accept negative leverage when buying for appreciation, owner-occupancy, or long-term hold.*

## H. RESIDENTIAL FINANCING NOTES

This is a **1-4 unit residential investment property**, which differs from commercial 5+ unit underwriting:

1. **Fannie/Freddie eligibility:** 1-4 unit properties qualify for residential mortgages with more favorable terms (30-year fixed, lower rates) than commercial financing.

2. **LTV:** Up to 75% for investment 2-4 unit properties (vs. 65-70% for commercial).

3. **Underwriting approach:** Residential lenders underwrite based on borrower income/credit (global cash flow) more than property NOI. A buyer with strong W-2/1099 income can qualify even if the property's DSCR is below 1.0.

4. **Buyer profile matters:** Owner-users (who live in one unit and rent the others) can get 80-85% LTV with lower rates (5.75-6.25%). This significantly changes the cash-on-cash returns.

5. **GRM is the primary metric:** Residential 3-4 unit buyers focus on GRM, price/unit, and price/SF rather than cap rate. Cap rate matters less because (a) residential financing is cheaper than commercial, and (b) many buyers factor in personal use/occupancy value.

6. **JADU risk for lenders:** The unpermitted JADU may cause issues with residential lenders who verify unit count against tax records (3 units on record vs. 4 functional). Buyer may need to underwrite as a 3-unit with JADU income as upside.

## I. UTILITY COST SUMMARY (CRITICAL FOR THIS PROPERTY)

All utilities are included in rent. This is the estimated annual utility burden the buyer assumes:

| Utility | Annual Cost | Source |
|---------|------------|--------|
| Water/Sewer | $4,800 | Appraisal (verified) |
| Trash | $1,600 | Benchmark |
| Gas | $2,400 | Benchmark (3 meters, owner pays) |
| Electric | $3,600 | Benchmark (3 meters, owner pays) |
| Common Area Electric | $1,500 | Benchmark |
| **Total Utilities** | **$13,900** | |

**vs. Appraisal utility expense:** $4,800 (water/sewer only)
**Understated by:** $9,100/yr

This is the most significant risk factor in the underwriting. The appraiser only included water/sewer ($4,800) in the operating statement. The buyer will pay an additional ~$9,100/yr in gas, electric, and trash that was not reflected in the appraisal's NOI.

**Mitigation strategies for buyer:**
1. Implement RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System) to recover 50-70% of gas/electric costs
2. Sub-meter gas and electric (cost: ~$5,000-$8,000 for installation)
3. Shift to tenant-paid utilities at turnover (vacancy decontrol + new lease terms)
4. Accept the cost as part of the all-inclusive rent strategy (higher gross rent offsets)
