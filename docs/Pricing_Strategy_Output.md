| $/Unit | $507,014 | $509,375 |
| $/SF | $429 | $411 |
| GRM | 15.9 | 15.1 |

---

## STEP 3: DERIVED PRICE BANDS

### Method A: $/Unit (4 functional units)

| Anchor | $/Unit | Implied Price | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Miranda (best MLS) | $387,500 | $1,550,000 | Floor -- subject superior in rents and unit mix |
| All Tier 1 avg | $601,563 | $2,406,250 | Includes Miranda drag |
| Appraisal comps avg (excl. Miranda) | $672,917 | $2,691,667 | Subject smaller building; discount warranted |
| Appraisal comps avg -15% (size adj) | $571,980 | $2,287,917 | 15% discount for 4,243 SF vs. avg 5,582 SF |

### Method B: $/SF

| Anchor | $/SF | Implied Price | Notes |
|--------|------|--------------|-------|
| Miranda | $372 | $1,578,396 | Floor |
| All Tier 1 avg | $455 | $1,930,565 | Blended |
| Appraisal comps avg (excl. Miranda) | $483 | $2,049,369 | Most relevant for renovated assets |
| Appraisal comp max (Camellia) | $515 | $2,185,145 | Ceiling per SF |

### Method C: GRM

| Anchor | GRM | × GSR | Implied Price | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|--------------|-------|
| 15.0 (appraisal comp avg) | 15.0 | $171,600 (PF) | $2,574,000 | Pro forma conservative |
| 15.0 | 15.0 | $184,800 (IP) | $2,772,000 | In-place rents |
| 13.6 (adjusted for utilities) | 13.6 | $171,600 | $2,333,760 | Discounted GRM for landlord-paid utilities |
| 12.0 (residential buyer GRM) | 12.0 | $171,600 | $2,059,200 | Residential 3-4 unit buyer metric |

### Appraisal Reference Point
- **Chase Appraisal (08/2025): $2,350,000** -- Sales comparison approach
- **Income Approach: $2,835,000** (GRM 180 monthly × $15,750/mo)
- **Reconciled to: $2,350,000** (weighted to sales comparison)

## STEP 4: CONSENSUS PRICING

### Price Convergence Analysis

| Method | Low | Mid | High |
|--------|-----|-----|------|
| $/Unit | $1,550,000 | $2,288,000 | $2,692,000 |
| $/SF | $1,578,000 | $2,049,000 | $2,185,000 |
| GRM (PF) | $2,059,000 | $2,334,000 | $2,574,000 |
| Appraisal | -- | $2,350,000 | -- |
| **Consensus** | **$1,950,000** | **$2,150,000** | **$2,350,000** |

### Pricing Ladder

| Tier | Price | Cap Rate (PF, reassessed) | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM (PF) | GRM (Current) | Rationale |
|------|-------|--------------------------|--------|------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Stretch List** | $2,350,000 | 4.50% | $587,500 | $554 | 13.7 | 12.7 | Matches appraisal. Defensible with income approach ($2.835M) but aggressive on $/SF. Tests the top. |
| **Suggested List** | $2,195,000 | 4.89% | $548,750 | $517 | 12.8 | 11.9 | Mid-consensus. $/SF in line with Camellia ($515). Below comp GRMs (14.7-16.5) = good value for buyer. Most defensible. |
| **Expected Sale (High)** | $2,100,000 | 5.17% | $525,000 | $495 | 12.2 | 11.4 | $/SF near Auckland ($500). Well below comp GRMs. Buyer gets strong rent-to-price ratio. |
| **Expected Sale (Low)** | $1,950,000 | 5.66% | $487,500 | $460 | 11.4 | 10.6 | Below all appraisal comp metrics. GRM discount reflects JADU risk and utility burden. |

## RATIONALE

### Primary Anchors Used

1. **Appraisal Comps $/SF ($434-$515):** The subject's 4,243 SF × $434-$515 = $1.84M-$2.19M. This is the most conservative anchor because the subject building is 24% smaller than the average appraisal comp (5,582 SF). $/SF normalizes for building size and is the most intellectually honest metric here.

2. **Appraisal Comps $/Unit ($631K-$725K, excl. Miranda):** At $631K × 4 = $2.525M; at $550K (discount for smaller units and JADU risk) × 4 = $2.2M. The $/unit approach favors the subject because it has 4 income-producing units.

3. **GRM (15.0 from appraisal comps):** Pro forma GSR $171,600 × 15.0 = $2.574M; current GSR $184,800 × 15.0 = $2.772M. The subject's GRM at $2.195M is only 12.8 (PF) / 11.9 (current) -- well below the comp average of 15.0, meaning the buyer gets a significantly better rent-to-price ratio than the comps. The utilities-included strategy inflates gross rent, so a lower GRM is appropriate, but the buyer still gets strong income relative to price.

### Adjustments

| Factor | Direction | Impact | Notes |
|--------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Building size (4,243 SF vs avg 5,582 SF) | Downward | -$200K to -$400K | Subject 24% smaller than appraisal comps |
| Unpermitted JADU | Downward | -$50K to -$100K | Risk of losing 4th unit income; legalization cost $5K-$15K |
| All utilities landlord-paid | Downward | -$50K to -$100K | $9,100/yr excess expense vs. tenant-paid comps |
| Full renovation (2024-2025) | Upward | Captured in Tier 1 | All new systems; lowest deferred maintenance in comp set |
| In-place rents ($15,400/mo) | Upward | $0 (already reflected) | Competitive with appraisal comps |
| Transit Priority Area + District NoHo catalyst | Upward | +$25K to +$50K | Future value catalyst not fully priced into 2024-2025 comps |

### Market Context

- **Rate environment:** 10-year Treasury at ~4.10% (Feb 2026). Residential mortgage rates ~6.50-6.75% for investment properties. Relatively stable; no near-term catalyst for rate compression.
- **NoHo submarket:** Active development with District NoHo. Strong rental demand for renovated product. Low vacancy for 3bd/2ba units.
- **Inventory:** Low supply of renovated 3-4 unit properties for sale. Miranda ($1.55M, Mar 2025) was the last renovated MLS comp -- nearly 12 months ago. Limited supply supports pricing.
- **DOM trends:** Renovated product moves faster. Miranda: 72 DOM. Appraisal comps: 11-21 DOM (very quick). Subject should target <90 DOM.
- **5841 Tujunga ($1.25M, 166 DOM)** is a warning signal: even renovated properties can stagnate if priced wrong or carrying distress (NOD). Pricing discipline matters.

## COMP SUPPORT TABLE

| Comp | Sale Price | Units | $/Unit | $/SF | GRM | Relevance to Subject |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|------|-----|---------------------|
| 11415 Miranda St | $1,550,000 | 4 | $387,500 | $372 | 16.5 | Best MLS comp; renovated, similar size. Subject superior (higher rents, newer systems). FLOOR. |
| 5626 Willowcrest Ave | $2,525,000 | 4 | $631,250 | $434 | 14.7 | Closest appraisal comp in price. Similar condition. Subject smaller (-1,572 SF). |
| 5508 Camellia Ave | $2,900,000 | 4 | $725,000 | $515 | 15.2 | Closest rent comp ($15,925 vs $15,400/mo). Subject smaller. CEILING. |
| 5648 Auckland Ave | $2,650,000 | 4 | $662,500 | $500 | 15.0 | Older sale (3/2024) but solid renovated comp. Subject smaller. |
| 5622 Willowcrest (active) | $2,595,000 list | 4 | $648,750 | $509 | -- | On-market. C1 condition (superior). 82 DOM suggests possible overpricing. |
| 11320 Emelita St | $970,000 | 3 | $323,333 | $388 | 12.9 | Baseline unrenovated comp. Same neighborhood. Shows renovation premium. |

---

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Rationale:** The comp data shows a genuine bifurcation between unrenovated MLS comps ($800K-$1.55M) and renovated appraisal comps ($2.525M-$2.9M). The subject falls between these tiers -- fully renovated like the appraisal comps but smaller in building size. The lack of recently closed renovated comps on MLS in the $1.5M-$2.5M range creates pricing uncertainty. The appraisal ($2.35M) provides third-party support but was performed for a refinance (which can trend optimistic).

**Key Risks to Pricing:**
1. **No MLS precedent above $1.55M:** The suggested list of $2.195M would be the highest-priced 3-4 unit residential sale in this NoHo subarea on MLS in recent memory (excl. off-market appraisal comps). Buyer agents may have sticker shock relative to MLS history.
2. **JADU exposure:** If buyer's lender requires 3-unit underwriting (ignoring JADU), the property only supports $5,100/unit × 3 = ~$1.6M-$1.8M on a pure 3-unit basis.
3. **Utility burden:** The $9,100/yr in landlord-paid utilities beyond water/sewer compresses returns and may push conservative buyers toward lower offers.
4. **Property tax reassessment:** At $2.1M purchase, taxes jump from $12.7K to $24.6K (+$11.9K/yr), reducing buyer NOI significantly.

## FINAL PRICING DECISION

### List Price: $2,350,000 (CONFIRMED)

**Rationale:** Matches Chase appraisal (08/2025). Every income metric at list price is still below comp averages:
- GRM 12.7 vs. comp avg 15.0 (buyer gets 15% more income per dollar than comps)
- $/Unit $587,500 vs. comp avg $672,917 (13% below comps)
- $/SF $554 is above comp avg $483 but the income profile justifies the premium

**Expected Sale Range:** $2,000,000 - $2,200,000
- Most likely outcome: $2,050,000 - $2,150,000 (8-13% off list)
- The appraisal provides negotiation leverage; income metrics support pricing throughout the expected sale range
- At $2.1M settled: $/unit $525K, $/SF $495, GRM 11.4 -- all at or below comp precedent

**BOV Presentation Strategy:**
- Lead with $2,350,000 list price backed by Chase appraisal
- Present buyer-normalized current income ($184,800 GSR, $133,330 NOI) to show income strength
- Show comp GRM comparison to demonstrate value proposition (buyer pays less per dollar of rent)
- Let the financial presentation naturally guide sophisticated buyers to the $2.0M-$2.2M offer range
