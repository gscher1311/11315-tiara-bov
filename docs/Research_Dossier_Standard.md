## 1. LOCATION GRADE: B

**Micro-Area:** Mid-Town North Hollywood / NoHo Arts District periphery

**Justification:** Strong walkability (79 Walk Score) with Metro B Line access within a 15-minute walk, situated in a submarket experiencing over $1B in planned transit-oriented development, offset by average school ratings and proximity to railroad/commercial corridor.

**Key Positive Factors:**
- Walk Score 79 (Very Walkable), Transit Score 59 (Good Transit), Bike Score 58 (Bikeable); Metro B Line (Red) North Hollywood Station approximately 0.7 miles
- District NoHo, a $1B+ Metro joint development with 1,500 residential units, 500K SF office, and 100K SF retail, approved and entering initial construction phases 2025-2026; this is the largest residential TOD project in Metro's history
- NoHo West shopping center (Trader Joe's, LA Fitness, Regal Cinemas) within 15-minute walk; NoHo Arts District with 20+ theaters, galleries, and dining less than 1 mile
- NoHo BID renewed for 6th year providing safety ambassadors, clean team, and streetscape improvements
- Transit Priority Area designation (ZIMAS confirmed)
- State Enterprise Zone (ZIMAS confirmed)

**Key Negative Factors:**
- School ratings below average: Maurice Sendak Elementary 4/10 (GreatSchools), North Hollywood Senior High 4/10
- Appraiser noted close proximity to railroad tracks, commercial use, and busy road (though stated not to affect marketability)

**Comparable Nearby Areas:**
- NoHo Arts District Core (Lankershim/Magnolia): B+ (direct Metro station access, higher density retail/dining, stronger rent premiums)
- Valley Village: B+ (quieter residential, better schools, less transit access)
- East North Hollywood (Vineland corridor): B- (less walkable, fewer amenities, lower rent ceiling)

## 8. FLOOD, SEISMIC & ENVIRONMENTAL (Gap-Fill Research)

### Flood Zone
- **FEMA Zone C** (minimal flood hazard) per ZIMAS Parcel Profile
- Not in Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
- No flood insurance required

### Seismic Hazards
- **Not in Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zone** per ZIMAS
- **Not in liquefaction zone** per ZIMAS
- **Not in landslide area** -- flat terrain, valley floor location
- North Hollywood generally Zone X (minimal seismic surface risk), though all of LA is subject to ground-shaking from regional faults (San Andreas, Hollywood, etc.)

### Environmental
- **EnviroStor (DTSC):** No active cleanup sites, hazardous waste facilities, or contamination records found at or adjacent to 11315 Tiara St as of Feb 2026 search
- **GeoTracker (SWRCB):** No underground storage tank leaks, groundwater contamination, or cleanup sites found at or adjacent to the property
- **Assessment:** Low environmental risk. Residential neighborhood, no industrial uses on or adjacent to the parcel

---

## 9. JADU LEGALIZATION PATHWAY (Gap-Fill Research)

### Current Status
Unit 4 is a ~481-550 SF 1bd/1ba unit that is **not legally permitted as a separate dwelling unit**. The appraiser classified the property as a 3-unit triplex. The unit shares an electric meter with Unit 3.

### AB 2533 Amnesty Program (Effective 1/1/2025)
AB 2533 establishes an amnesty program for unpermitted ADUs and JADUs **built before January 1, 2020**. Under this law:
- Cities cannot deny legalization based solely on code violations
- Units must meet basic health and safety standards
- Amnesty from past penalties

**Applicability to Subject:** The JADU at 11315 Tiara was likely created during the 2024 renovation (the carport-to-living conversion permit was for the 3-unit building, not a 4th unit). If the unit was **not in existence before 1/1/2020**, AB 2533 amnesty would **not apply**.

### Standard JADU Permitting Path (Government Code 65852.22)
If AB 2533 does not apply, the standard JADU path under state law provides:
- JADUs are **permitted by right** in single-family and multifamily residential zones
- Maximum 500 SF
- Must be within the existing footprint of a primary residence or accessory structure
- Can share sanitation facilities with primary unit
- **No separate utility connections required** (can share with primary unit -- this matches the subject's setup)
- No additional parking required
- Owner-occupancy requirement may apply (waived through 2025 under certain conditions; check current status)

### Key Considerations for Buyer
- A buyer would need to determine if the unit qualifies for AB 2533 amnesty or must go through standard JADU permitting
- The unit at 481 SF is under the 500 SF JADU maximum
- The shared electric meter with Unit 3 is consistent with JADU requirements
- Cost to legalize: typically $5,000-$15,000 including plans, permit fees, and any required health/safety upgrades
- Timeline: 3-6 months for standard JADU permit processing in LA
- Risk: Until legalized, income from Unit 4 cannot be guaranteed in underwriting

---

## 10. RENT CONTROL REGISTRATION (Gap-Fill Research)

### RSO Status
- Property is subject to the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)
- 4% maximum annual rent increase for in-place tenants (current allowable increase rate)
- Vacancy decontrol applies: landlord may set rent at market rate when a unit is vacated

### SCEP (Systematic Code Enforcement Program)
- LAHD inspects rental properties with 2+ dwelling units at least once every four years
- Annual SCEP fee: $67.94 per rental unit
- Landlord may pass through 50% ($2.83/mo) to tenants with 30-day written notice
- Subject would be registered as a 3-unit RSO property (JADU not separately registered if unpermitted)

### Registration Requirement
- Landlords must register RSO units annually by February 28
- Registration confirms unit count, rent amounts, and tenant information
- Cannot verify if current owner has registered -- recommend buyer verify at closing

### REAP (Rent Escrow Account Program)
- No indication the property is in REAP (would indicate unresolved code violations)
- 3 code enforcement cases on file at LADBS -- buyer should verify these are resolved to avoid REAP risk

## 11. KEY TALKING POINTS

1. **Extensively Renovated / Essentially New Construction:** Property was demolished to studs and rebuilt with all new major systems (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, 400A panel, 13 mini-splits). All permits finaled late 2024 / early 2025. Effective age of 25 years per appraiser, but mechanical systems are brand new.

2. **Strong Rent Roll with Upside:** $15,400/mo at full occupancy ($184,800 annualized). Unit 4 JADU currently at $2,500/mo vs. appraiser's $3,300/mo market rent, representing $800/mo ($9,600/yr) of immediate upside on that unit alone. Furnished midterm rental strategy could push even higher.

3. **Significant Equity Creation Story:** Owner purchased for $1M in Oct 2023, completed full renovation, and Chase appraised at $2.35M in Aug 2025. Income approach indicates $2.835M value. Now has $1.4M loan at ~60% LTV.

4. **Transit-Oriented Location with Major Catalyst:** 0.7 miles to Metro B Line (Red) North Hollywood Station. District NoHo, a $1B+ Metro joint development with 1,500 units and 500K SF office, is entering construction directly at the station. Walk Score 79.

5. **Turnkey 3-Unit (+ JADU) with No Deferred Maintenance:** All new systems, C2 condition rating, no soft-story requirement, 4 parking spaces. Buyer can step in and operate immediately.

6. **Transit Priority Area + State Enterprise Zone:** Dual designation provides density bonus eligibility and potential tax incentives for qualified buyers.

## 12. RISKS & WATCH ITEMS

| Risk | Severity | Detail |
|------|----------|--------|
| **JADU (Unit 4) Unpermitted** | **HIGH** | 4th unit not legally permitted. Appraiser classified as 3-unit triplex. Shares electric meter with Unit 3. Buyer must evaluate: legalize as JADU (est. $5K-$15K, 3-6 months), accept risk, or adjust pricing. AB 2533 amnesty may not apply (unit likely created post-2020). |
| **Property Taxes Delinquent** | **MEDIUM** | 2025 taxes delinquent per NiteOwlPro. Status as of Feb 2026 unverified. Buyer should verify at close and confirm no penalties/liens. |
| **3 Code Enforcement Cases** | **MEDIUM** | LADBS shows 3 cases. Status and resolution unknown from available docs. If unresolved, property could be placed in REAP. Buyer due diligence required. |
| **Utility Cost Exposure** | **MEDIUM** | All utilities included in rent per seller. No sub-metering for gas. Electric shared between Units 3 & 4. Buyer absorbs all utility costs (~$7,200-$9,600/yr estimated). |
| **RSO Rent Control** | **LOW-MED** | 4% max annual increase for in-place tenants. Vacancy decontrol applies at turnover. |
| **SF Discrepancy** | **LOW** | Assessor shows 3,853 SF vs. appraiser measured 4,243 SF (reflects post-renovation additions). Use appraiser figure for marketing. |
| **Railroad Proximity** | **LOW** | Appraiser noted but stated no impact on marketability. |

## 14. OM LOCATION PARAGRAPH (Draft)

Ideally positioned in the heart of Mid-Town North Hollywood, 11315 Tiara Street offers residents exceptional access to one of the San Fernando Valley's most dynamic and rapidly evolving submarkets. The property benefits from a Walk Score of 79 (Very Walkable) and a Transit Score of 59 (Good Transit), with the Metro B Line (Red) North Hollywood Station located just 0.7 miles away, providing direct subway service to Hollywood, Downtown LA, and beyond. The neighborhood is anchored by NoHo West, a premier retail destination featuring Trader Joe's, LA Fitness, and Regal Cinemas, while the celebrated NoHo Arts District, home to over 20 professional theaters, galleries, and eclectic dining, sits less than one mile to the east. North Hollywood is poised for transformative growth with District NoHo, a $1B+ Metro joint development that will deliver 1,500 new residential units, 500,000 SF of creative office space, and 100,000 SF of neighborhood-serving retail directly at the transit station. This generational investment, the largest residential TOD project in Metro's history, signals a powerful trajectory for property values across the submarket. Proximity to major freeways (170, 101, 134) and employment centers in Burbank, Studio City, and greater Los Angeles further solidify the location's appeal to a broad renter demographic seeking urban convenience with Valley livability.
