# TARGET BUYER PROFILE & ANTICIPATED OBJECTIONS

## Target Buyer Profile

The ideal buyer for 11315 Tiara Street is a private investor or owner-user seeking a turnkey, income-producing residential asset in a transit-oriented North Hollywood location. The property is best suited for:

- **Owner-users** who intend to occupy one unit and rent the remaining three, benefiting from favorable residential financing terms (80-85% LTV, lower rates) while generating rental income that substantially offsets the mortgage
- **Small-portfolio investors** building a residential rental portfolio with Fannie/Freddie-eligible properties (1-4 units) who value the 30-year fixed-rate financing advantage over commercial loan terms
- **Mid-term rental operators** who can leverage the furnished JADU and utilities-included strategy to capture premium rents from traveling professionals, medical workers, and entertainment industry contractors
- **1031 exchange buyers** seeking to deploy capital into a stabilized, recently renovated asset with minimal near-term capital expenditure requirements

The buyer should be comfortable with the RSO framework (vacancy decontrol mitigates the 4% annual cap for in-place tenants) and capable of managing or outsourcing the operation of a small residential rental property.

## Anticipated Buyer Objections (4)

**"There are no MLS closed sales above $1.55M for a 3-4 unit in this area. How do you justify $2.35M?"**
The MLS comp set is dominated by unrenovated and distressed properties (probate, REO, NOD, city violations) with rents of $900-$3,100 per month. The subject generates $15,400 per month -- more than double the best MLS comp (11415 Miranda at $7,845/mo). The three appraiser-selected closed comps, all renovated 4-unit properties in North Hollywood, traded at $2.525M-$2.9M in the past 18 months. At $2.35M, the subject's GRM of 12.7 is 15% below the renovated comp average of 15.0, meaning the buyer acquires more income per dollar than any recent comparable sale.

**"The JADU is unpermitted. Why should I pay for a 4th unit that isn't legal?"**
The JADU's $2,500 monthly rent represents 16% of total gross income. Under AB 2533 (effective January 2025) and Government Code 65852.22, California provides clear legalization pathways for JADUs. At 550 SF (under the 500 SF JADU maximum -- note: measured by seller, appraiser measured 481 SF which is compliant), with shared electric per JADU code requirements, the unit is well-positioned for permitting. Estimated legalization cost is $5,000-$15,000 with a 3-6 month timeline. Even if a buyer underwrites Unit 4 at $0 rent, the remaining three units generate $12,900 per month ($154,800 annually), still supporting a price above $1.9M on comparable metrics.

**"All utilities are landlord-paid. What does that actually cost me?"**
Estimated annual utility burden is approximately $13,900 (water/sewer $4,800, gas $2,400, electric $3,600, trash $1,600, common area $1,500). This is already fully reflected in the underwriting -- total expenses of $45,926 include all utility costs. The utilities-included strategy supports premium rents: the subject's 3-bedroom units at $4,200-$4,400 include utilities, while comparable units without utilities included rent for $3,400-$3,900. The net effect is a wash or slightly positive. A buyer who prefers tenant-paid utilities can implement RUBS (Ratio Utility Billing System) to recover 50-70% of gas and electric costs, or shift to tenant-paid at unit turnover via vacancy decontrol.

**"The property taxes will be reassessed at my purchase price. How does that affect returns?"**
At a $2.35M purchase, annual property taxes increase from the current $12,714 to approximately $27,495 (1.17% of purchase price), an increase of $14,781 per year. This is standard Proposition 13 reassessment and affects every acquisition in California. Even with reassessed taxes, the property generates a net operating income of approximately $118,500, representing a 5.04% cap rate -- competitive for a fully renovated, transit-adjacent residential asset in Los Angeles. For context, the three appraiser-selected comparable sales all transacted at similar or lower cap rates after their respective reassessments.
