## Property Tax Reassessment Note

Property taxes will be reassessed at the purchase price per California Proposition 13. At $2,350,000, annual taxes increase from $12,714 to approximately $27,495 (+$14,781/yr). With reassessed taxes, adjusted NOI is approximately $118,549.

## Rationale

The offering price of $2,350,000 is supported by a Chase appraisal dated August 14, 2025, using the sales comparison approach. The property's buyer-normalized gross scheduled rent of $184,800 per year produces a GRM of 12.7 -- meaningfully below the renovated comparable average of 15.0. This means the buyer acquires 15% more rental income per dollar invested than the average comparable transaction. The price per unit of $587,500 is 13% below the renovated comp average of $672,917, providing further margin for the buyer. The price per square foot of $540 exceeds the comp average of $483, reflecting the property's smaller building size relative to the comparable set; however, the income metrics demonstrate that the property punches above its weight on a revenue basis.
