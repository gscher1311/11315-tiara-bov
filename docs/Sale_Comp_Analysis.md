## Per-Comp Analysis

### Comp 1: 11415 Miranda St ($1,550,000)
The most directly comparable MLS closed sale. Miranda is a renovated 4-unit property with modern finishes including quartz countertops, Carrera marble tile, in-unit washer/dryer, ductless split HVAC, and tankless water heaters. At 4,164 square feet, it is similar in size to the subject (4,350 SF). However, Miranda's actual monthly rent of $7,845 (with one unit vacant) is roughly half the subject's $15,400. The subject's substantially higher income, driven by larger unit sizes (three 3-bedroom units vs. Miranda's mix of 2- and 3-bedrooms) and a furnished JADU, supports a significant premium. Miranda establishes the floor for renovated properties in this submarket at $387,500 per unit.

### Comp 2: 5626 Willowcrest Ave ($2,525,000)
A renovated 4-unit property rated C2 (Good) by the appraiser, comparable to the subject's condition. Willowcrest generated $14,300 per month in rent at the time of sale -- closely aligned with the subject's conservative pro forma. The key difference is building size: Willowcrest's 5,815 square feet exceeds the subject by approximately 1,465 square feet, which accounts for its higher total price. At $434 per square foot, Willowcrest provides a relevant benchmark for the subject's $/SF positioning. The appraiser noted a small negative adjustment for Willowcrest's proximity to a busy road -- a factor that does not apply to the subject's quieter residential street.

### Comp 3: 5648 Auckland Ave ($2,650,000)
Another renovated 4-unit in North Hollywood rated C2 (Good). Auckland features all 3-bedroom/3-bathroom units and an 8-car garage -- superior parking to the subject's 4-space driveway. The appraiser applied an $80,000 negative adjustment for this parking differential. Auckland sold in March 2024, making it the oldest sale in the comp set at 23 months. Its $500 per square foot and $662,500 per unit provide context for the upper range of the market, though the larger building size (5,299 SF) should be noted when comparing to the subject.

### Comp 4: 5508 Camellia Ave ($2,900,000)
The highest-priced comparable and the closest match in terms of rent level. Camellia's $15,925 per month in rent is remarkably close to the subject's $15,400. This property sold in only 11 days on market, indicating strong buyer demand for renovated, income-producing assets at this price tier. Camellia is larger at 5,632 square feet and includes larger units (4- and 5-bedroom configurations), which partially accounts for the higher total price. At $515 per square foot, Camellia establishes the ceiling for $/SF in the comparable set.

### Comp 5: 11320 Emelita St ($970,000) -- Baseline Reference
Included as a pre-renovation baseline. Emelita is located one block from the subject with identical LARD2 zoning and a similar lot size (7,003 SF vs. 7,000 SF). Sold in probate with rents of $6,265 per month, this comp illustrates the value created by the subject's renovation -- transforming a similar property from the $970,000 unrenovated tier to the $2.35 million renovated tier through systematic capital improvements.

### Comp 6: 6003 Cahuenga Blvd ($1,250,000) -- Maintained Reference
A well-maintained but unrenovated 4-unit on a commercial boulevard. At 116 days on market and $312,500 per unit, this comp demonstrates the significant pricing gap between maintained and fully renovated properties in the submarket. The subject's complete renovation commands a substantial premium over this tier.

## Market Narrative

The North Hollywood multifamily market shows a clear bifurcation between unrenovated properties trading in the $800,000-$1,250,000 range and renovated assets trading at $2,525,000-$2,900,000. This bifurcation reflects the substantial rent premium that renovated 3-bedroom units command ($4,000-$4,400/month) versus unrenovated units ($900-$2,800/month). Limited supply of newly renovated 3-4 unit properties -- the last renovated MLS closed sale was 11415 Miranda in March 2025 -- supports pricing for turnkey assets. Properties that traded quickly (Camellia at 11 DOM, Willowcrest and Auckland at 21 DOM) were renovated and priced at or below $725,000 per unit, confirming buyer appetite for quality product at this scale.
