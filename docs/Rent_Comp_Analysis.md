## Narrative

The subject's current rents of $4,200-$4,400 for the 3-bedroom units are supported by comparable asking rents in the immediate area, which range from $3,200 to $4,600 with an average of $3,841. The subject's rents sit above average, justified by the property's fully renovated condition, all-new building systems, and the utilities-included strategy that adds an estimated $150-$200 per month in perceived value per unit.

The JADU at $2,500 per month operates as a furnished mid-term rental, a strategy that captures a meaningful premium over the unfurnished 1-bedroom average of $2,231. FurnishedFinder listings in the area confirm that furnished units command $2,500-$3,000 per month for similar configurations.

The conservative pro forma of $14,300 per month ($171,600 annually) provides a defensible baseline that accounts for potential market softening or a shift away from the utilities-included model. The current rents of $15,400 per month ($184,800 annually) represent achievable stabilized income based on demonstrated occupancy and active market comparables.

**Important caveats:** All rent comps reflect asking rents, not verified achieved rents. Actual rents may be 2-5% below asking depending on negotiation and concessions. RSO limits annual increases to 4% for in-place tenants, but vacancy decontrol allows market reset at turnover.
