## Property Narrative

The LAAA Team is pleased to present 11315 Tiara Street, a fully renovated triplex with a junior accessory dwelling unit in the heart of Mid-Town North Hollywood. The property consists of three spacious 3-bedroom/2-bathroom units and one 1-bedroom/1-bathroom JADU, totaling approximately 4,350 square feet of living space on a 7,000-square-foot lot. Originally constructed in 1926 with additions in 2005, the property underwent a comprehensive renovation in 2024-2025 that included new electrical (400-amp panel with 3 meters), new plumbing, 13 mini-split HVAC units, and complete interior remodeling -- effectively delivering new-construction systems in an established residential setting.

The property generates $184,800 in annual gross scheduled rent at full occupancy, with three-bedroom units commanding $4,200-$4,400 per month and the furnished JADU at $2,500 per month. All utilities are included in rent, a strategy that supports premium rents and appeals to the mid-term rental demographic that increasingly populates this submarket. At the offered price of $2,350,000, the property delivers a GRM of 12.7 against a comparable sales average of 15.0, meaning a buyer acquires significantly more income per dollar invested than recent comparable transactions in the area.

North Hollywood's Mid-Town corridor is positioned for material appreciation driven by District NoHo, a $1 billion-plus Metro joint development delivering 1,500 residential units and 500,000 square feet of office space at the North Hollywood Metro B Line station, less than one mile from the property. The property's Transit Priority Area designation, LARD2 zoning, and TOC Tier 1 eligibility provide a buyer with future density bonus options. With all major capital expenditures completed and six finaled building permits on record, a buyer can operate immediately with minimal deferred maintenance for the foreseeable future.
