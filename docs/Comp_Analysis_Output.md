## EXCLUDED COMPS (6) WITH REASONING

| # | Address | Units | Sale Price | Reason for Exclusion |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| X1 | 11233 Victory Blvd | 3 | $800,000 | REO distressed sale, all 1bd/1ba (incomparable unit mix), 1,859 SF (less than half subject size), all units vacant. Not a market-rate transaction. |
| X2 | 11618 Friar St | 4 | $952,940 | Not renovated, all 2bd/1ba, much lower rents ($5,910/mo), different submarket (91606). Too far from subject in condition and rent level. |
| X3 | 5738 Klump Ave | 4 | $1,050,000 | Tiny building (2,380 SF), mostly 1bd units, very low rents ($4,706/mo). Value-add/redevelopment play, not comparable to stabilized renovated asset. |
| X4 | 11606 Friar St | 4 | $975,000 | Not renovated, all 2bd/1ba, "sold prior to processing" (possibly off-market), different submarket (91606). Substantially identical to excluded 11618 Friar. |
| X5 | 6058 Craner Ave | 3 | $1,000,000 | Development/land comp -- 15,231 SF lot (2x subject), 100% vacant, bonus density for 15 units + 4 ADUs. Price reflects land value, not operating value. |
| X6 | 5761 Fair Ave | 4 | $1,000,000 | Distressed: sold at 80% of list price (cash sale), city violations noted. Not representative of market-rate renovated asset transaction. |

## THE GAP: CRITICAL ANALYSIS

There is a significant pricing gap between the MLS comps and the appraisal comps:

- **MLS closed range:** $800,000 - $1,550,000 (most in the $950K-$1.25M band)
- **Appraisal closed range:** $2,525,000 - $2,900,000
- **Gap:** ~$975,000 between the best MLS comp ($1.55M) and the lowest appraisal comp ($2.525M)

**Why the gap exists:**
1. **Condition divergence:** The MLS comps are overwhelmingly unrenovated or distressed (probate, REO, NOD, city violations, vacant). The appraisal comps are all fully renovated with modern finishes. The subject's full renovation places it firmly in the upper tier.
2. **Unit mix and rent level:** The MLS comps mostly have 1bd and 2bd units with rents of $900-$2,800/mo. The subject has 3bd/2ba units at $4,200-$4,400/mo -- more than double most MLS comp rents. The appraisal comps have similar 3-5bd units with rents of $3,500-$4,400/mo.
3. **Building size:** The appraisal comps average 5,462 SF vs. subject's 4,243 SF. The subject is smaller, which partially explains why it should trade below the appraisal comp average.
4. **The Miranda comp bridges the gap:** 11415 Miranda ($1.55M) is the only renovated MLS comp. It sold at $387,500/unit and $372/SF -- below the appraisal comps but above all other MLS comps. The subject should trade above Miranda due to larger, higher-rent unit mix (3bd/2ba vs. Miranda's mix of 2bd and 3bd).

**Where the subject fits:**
The subject is superior to every MLS comp (fully renovated, all 3bd/2ba, highest rents) but slightly inferior to the appraisal comps (smaller building, unpermitted JADU, utilities included = higher expenses for buyer). The subject should trade in the range of **$1.75M - $2.35M**, with the appraisal value of $2.35M representing the ceiling.

## PER-COMP ANALYSIS

### Comp 1: 11415 Miranda St ($1,550,000) -- MOST IMPORTANT MLS COMP

**Similarity:** This is the closest MLS comparable. Both are renovated 4-unit properties in North Hollywood with modern finishes (quartz, ductless HVAC, stainless appliances). Miranda's 4,164 SF is close to the subject's 4,243 SF. Both have a mix of 3bd and 2bd units.

**Metrics comparison:**
- $/Unit: Miranda $387,500 vs. subject TBD
- $/SF: Miranda $372 vs. subject TBD
- GRM: Miranda 16.5 (based on actual rents with 1 vacant unit)
- Miranda's actual rents ($7,845/mo with 1 vacant) are substantially lower than subject's $15,400/mo -- but Miranda had a vacant unit and its occupied units were at $2,350-$3,095/mo (lower than subject's $4,200-$4,400/mo)

**Adjustments:**
- Subject SUPERIOR: Higher rents ($15,400 vs. $7,845 actual), all 3bd/2ba units (vs. mix of 2bd/3bd), newer renovation (2024-2025 vs. unspecified), all new mechanical systems
- Subject INFERIOR: Utilities included in rent (buyer absorbs $7-10K/yr utility cost), JADU unpermitted (risk), 1 less legal unit (3 vs. 4)
- Net: **Subject significantly superior** to Miranda. Should trade at a substantial premium.

**Estimated adjustment range:** +$200K to +$600K above Miranda's $1.55M = **$1.75M - $2.15M implied from Miranda**

### Comp 2: 5508 Camellia Ave ($2,900,000) -- HIGHEST APPRAISAL COMP

**Similarity:** Both are renovated 4-unit properties in North Hollywood with similar rent levels. Camellia's $15,925/mo is remarkably close to subject's $15,400/mo.

**Metrics comparison:**
- $/Unit: Camellia $725,000 vs. subject TBD
- $/SF: Camellia $515 vs. subject TBD
- GRM: Camellia 15.2

**Adjustments:**
- Subject INFERIOR: Smaller building (4,243 vs. 5,632 SF = -1,389 SF), JADU unpermitted, utilities included, fewer bedrooms per unit
- Subject SUPERIOR: Similar rent level suggests comparable quality
- Subject INFERIOR: 8-car parking at Camellia vs. 4 at subject
- Net: **Subject inferior** to Camellia. Should trade at a discount.

**Estimated adjustment range:** -$300K to -$500K below Camellia's $2.9M = **$2.4M - $2.6M implied from Camellia**

### Comp 3: 5626 Willowcrest Ave ($2,525,000) -- CLOSEST APPRAISAL COMP IN PRICE

**Similarity:** Both are renovated 4-unit properties in North Hollywood. Willowcrest's $14,300/mo rent is close to subject's conservative pro forma ($14,300/mo).

**Metrics comparison:**
- $/Unit: Willowcrest $631,250
- $/SF: Willowcrest $434
- GRM: Willowcrest 14.7

**Adjustments:**
- Subject INFERIOR: Smaller building (4,243 vs. 5,815 SF), JADU unpermitted, utilities included
- Subject SUPERIOR: Subject not on a busy road (appraiser adjusted Willowcrest +$25K for busy road)
- Net: **Subject slightly inferior.** Should trade at a modest discount.

**Estimated adjustment range:** -$100K to -$250K below Willowcrest's $2.525M = **$2.275M - $2.425M implied from Willowcrest**

### Comp 4: 5648 Auckland Ave ($2,650,000)

**Similarity:** Renovated 4-unit in North Hollywood. All 3bd/3ba units (slightly larger than subject's 3bd/2ba).

**Adjustments:**
- Subject INFERIOR: Smaller building (4,243 vs. 5,299 SF), fewer bathrooms, JADU unpermitted
- Subject INFERIOR: Auckland has 8-car garage vs. subject's 4 driveway spaces (-$80K adj per appraiser)
- Older sale date (3/2024 = 23 months ago, less reliable)
- Net: **Subject inferior.** Discount for size and parking.

**Estimated adjustment range:** -$200K to -$400K = **$2.25M - $2.45M implied from Auckland**

### Comp 5: 11320 Emelita St ($970,000) -- FLOOR/BASELINE COMP

**Similarity:** Nearly identical location (Emelita St is 1 block from subject's Tiara St). Same LARD2 zoning, similar lot size (7,003 vs. 7,000 SF). 3 units vs. subject's 3+1. Year built 1923 vs. 1926.

**Key difference:** Emelita is unrenovated and sold in probate. Rents are $6,265/mo vs. subject's $15,400/mo. This comp represents what the subject property was worth BEFORE the renovation (the subject itself last sold for $1M in 2023 in similar pre-renovation condition).

**Value of renovation:** Subject's $1M purchase + renovation + 2.5x rent increase demonstrates the value creation that justifies pricing above the unrenovated comp tier.

### Comp 6: 6003 Cahuenga Blvd ($1,250,000)

**Similarity:** 4 units, well-maintained, NoHo area. Mixed unit sizes. Corner lot with good parking.

**Key differences:** Not renovated (well-maintained is not the same as fully renovated), located on a commercial boulevard (Cahuenga vs. residential Tiara), different unit mix, no rent control (which can be positive for buyers). 116 DOM suggests it was overpriced initially.

**Adjustment:** Subject is substantially superior in condition and rent level. This comp supports a floor above $1.25M but does not inform the ceiling.

## PRICING IMPLICATIONS (For Phase 2B)

Based on the comp analysis, the subject property's value range indicated by comps is:

| Approach | Low | Mid | High |
|----------|-----|-----|------|
| **Miranda-anchored (MLS best)** | $1,750,000 | $1,950,000 | $2,150,000 |
| **Willowcrest-anchored (appraisal)** | $2,275,000 | $2,350,000 | $2,425,000 |
| **Camellia-anchored (appraisal)** | $2,400,000 | $2,500,000 | $2,600,000 |
| **GRM (15.0 x $15,400/mo)** | -- | $2,772,000 | -- |
| **GRM (15.0 x $14,300/mo conservative)** | -- | $2,574,000 | -- |
| **Appraisal (reconciled)** | -- | $2,350,000 | -- |

**Consensus range for pricing discussion:** $1,950,000 - $2,350,000

The wide range reflects the genuine uncertainty created by the comp gap. The pricing strategy (Phase 2B) will need to determine where within this range to set the suggested list price based on the broker's market knowledge and seller expectations.
