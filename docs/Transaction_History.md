## Narrative

The property's transaction history illustrates a clear value-creation story. The previous owners, the Garabedian family, listed the property twice in 2022 -- first at $1.299 million, then at $1.15 million -- without attracting a buyer. At that time, the building housed Section 8 tenants paying $936-$958 per month in a physically dated condition. The property ultimately sold to the current owner in October 2023 for $1,000,000.

Following acquisition, the owner undertook a comprehensive renovation that effectively rebuilt the property from the studs out: a new 400-amp electrical panel with three meters, 13 ductless mini-split HVAC units, full plumbing replacement, and complete interior remodeling across all units. Six building permits were filed and finaled between late 2024 and early 2025. The renovation transformed monthly rental income from approximately $2,900 (pre-renovation) to $15,400 at full occupancy -- a 5.3x increase. In August 2025, Chase appraised the property at $2,350,000, and the owner subsequently refinanced with a $1,400,000 conventional mortgage through Rocket Mortgage at approximately 60% loan-to-value.
