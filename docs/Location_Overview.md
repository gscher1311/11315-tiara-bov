# LOCATION OVERVIEW

## Location Narrative

Ideally positioned in Mid-Town North Hollywood, 11315 Tiara Street offers residents direct access to one of the San Fernando Valley's most dynamic and rapidly evolving submarkets. The property benefits from a Walk Score of 79 (Very Walkable) and a Transit Score of 59 (Good Transit), with the Metro B Line (Red) North Hollywood Station located approximately 0.7 miles away, providing direct subway service to Hollywood, Downtown Los Angeles, and beyond. The neighborhood is anchored by NoHo West, a premier retail destination featuring Trader Joe's, LA Fitness, and Regal Cinemas, while the celebrated NoHo Arts District -- home to over 20 professional theaters, galleries, and eclectic dining -- sits less than one mile to the east.

North Hollywood is poised for transformative growth. District NoHo, a $1 billion-plus Metro joint development at the North Hollywood Station, will deliver 1,500 new residential units, 500,000 square feet of creative office space, and 100,000 square feet of neighborhood-serving retail. This is the largest residential transit-oriented development project in Metro's history, and its construction signals a powerful trajectory for property values across the submarket. The NoHo BID, now in its sixth year, provides dedicated safety ambassadors, a clean team, and streetscape improvements that continue to elevate the neighborhood's livability.

Proximity to major freeways (170, 101, 134) and employment centers in Burbank, Studio City, and greater Los Angeles solidifies the location's appeal to a broad renter demographic. The property sits within a Transit Priority Area and a State Enterprise Zone, dual designations that provide density bonus eligibility and potential tax incentives for qualified buyers. As institutional capital continues to flow into transit-adjacent development across the Valley, properties within walking distance of the Metro station stand to benefit from sustained rent growth and appreciation pressure.
