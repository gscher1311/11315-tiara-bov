## Narrative

The current on-market inventory for renovated 3-4 unit properties in North Hollywood is extremely thin, with only two active listings identified.

5841 Tujunga Avenue is listed at $1,250,000 for a renovated 4-unit property, but the listing carries significant red flags: a Notice of Default has been filed, the property has been on market for 166 days, and no unit mix or financial information is provided. The extended DOM and distressed status suggest the listing may be stale or the property may have undisclosed issues. This listing does not represent a competitive threat to the subject -- rather, it demonstrates that even renovated properties can languish on market when circumstances (NOD, lack of financial transparency) undermine buyer confidence.

5622 Willowcrest Avenue is listed at $2,595,000 for a 4-unit property rated C1 (superior condition) by the appraiser. At $648,750 per unit and $509 per square foot with 82 days on market, this listing provides a relevant pricing benchmark for the upper end of the renovated market. The subject at $2,350,000 ($587,500 per unit) is priced 9.4% below the Willowcrest listing, offering buyers a compelling alternative with similar income potential at a lower entry point.

The limited active supply works in the seller's favor. A buyer seeking a turnkey, renovated residential income property in transit-oriented North Hollywood has very few options, positioning the subject to attract serious interest from a targeted buyer pool.
